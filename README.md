Soccer Player & Ball Multi-Object Tracking with YOLOv8 + DeepSORT, ByteTrack, and BoT-SORT. Supports team assignment, player re-identification, and occlusion recovery with a plug-and-play modular architecture.

This project enables consistent player and ball tracking in soccer match videos, with robust ID assignment even across re-entries, partial occlusions, and crowded scenes.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>  # use HTTPS, SSH, or CLI based on your preference
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

3. **Create the `models` folder**
    **Important**: You *must* create a `models` folder and place your fine-tuned YOLO model file (`best.pt`) inside it. Otherwise the tracker will fail to load.

   ```bash
   mkdir models
   # then move your fine-tuned best.pt into this folder
   ```

   **Make sure this path is correct**:

   ```
   models/best.pt
   ```

4. **Set up a virtual environment and activate it**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   *(or use your preferred environment manager)*

5. **Install the dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Verify model placement**
   Check that you have:

   ```
   models/best.pt
   ```

   before running, or you will see a model loading error.

7. **Run the main script**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   You will see three options to select from. Choose one, and wait for a few minutes for processing to complete (execution time depends on your system‚Äôs computational power ‚Äî using a GPU is highly recommended).

# üìù Project Details

* **Object Detection Backbone**: YOLOv8 fine-tuned on soccer players
* **Tracking Algorithms**:

  * ByteTrack (for strong identity preservation under occlusion)
  * DeepSORT with MobileNet re-identification features
  * BoT-SORT (inbuilt tracker with tuned hyperparameters)
* **Modularity**: The architecture supports easy switching between trackers.
* **Efficiency**: Designed for near real-time processing on standard GPUs.

# IMPORTANT NOTE

If you are reviewing this project (e.g., internship reviewers), please note:

* Pese create a folder "models" after cloning.
* Model file (`best.pt`) must be placed inside `models/`
* Video results shown above are provided for quick comparison
* Code is organized modularly, with clear separation of detection and tracking
* Performance may vary based on hardware (tests were run on an RTX 4060 8GB VRAM)
